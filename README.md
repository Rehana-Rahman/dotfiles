# Dotfiles

My Neovim setup - lightweight, fast, and exactly how I like it.  
Saved here so I can clone it anytime and feel at home on a new machine.

---

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Rehana-Rahman/dotfiles.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Open Neovim and let it install everything automatically.

---

## Notes

- Uses a patched Nerd Font - make sure your terminal supports glyphs.
- Keymaps live in `lua/config/mappings.lua`.
- Tweak plugins and settings in `init.lua`.
- If something breaks, delete `~/.local/share/nvim` and reopen Neovim.
